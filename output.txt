Enter the center (x, y, z) and radius of a bubble (EOF to end): bubble (1, 1, 1) R=2 and bubble (3, 3, 3) R=3 partially overlap
bubble (3, 3, 3) R=3 and bubble (7, 7, 7) R=1 are disjoint
bubble (7, 7, 7) R=1 is included in bubble (5, 5, 5) R=5
bubble (5, 5, 5) R=5 includes bubble (5, 5, 5) R=4
bubble with the largest volume: bubble (5, 5, 5) R=5, V=523.33
